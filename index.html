                Hi, my name is Hamidur Rahman. I am an aspiring Backend Java Developer. Currently I am in my senior year
                at City University of New York - Queens College, where I am pursuing BA in
                Computer Science. I am expected to graduate in June 2020. I am currently working as a College Assistant under
                <em><strong>Registrar</strong></em> department at LaGuardia Community College. I was awarded with LaGCC Front Line
                Staff Star Award in 2019.

                <br><br>

                I am really passionate about building/working with large scale application in Java. To build something big
                big, useful and that can make impact, lots of tools are necessary. That's when framework like <em><strong>Spring</strong></em> and
                <em><strong>Hibernate</strong></em> (for Database) comes into play. To stand aside from others I have learned applicable knowledge of these and
                have built programs to demonstrate the skills. All programs are available in my <em><strong>GitHub</strong></em> account.

                <br><br>

                Beside this, in my spare time I like to watch movies/tv shows, listen to music, watch sports or take a long drive.

                    and persist data as well as queries can be performed on above retrieved data. An Admin is able
                    to specify how many links should be crawled from the given link and depth of search for each link.
